Recovery of gold from a golden ore

- Prepare a prototype model of machine learning for "Ciphra" company. This company develops solutions for the effective operation of industrial enterprises.
- The model should predict the recovery rate of gold from gold-bearing ore. Use data with extraction and cleaning parameters.
- The model will help to optimize production so as not to start a company with unprofitable characteristics.

General conclusion

- The data has been studied and pre-processed.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis, removed outliers.
- Selected features for training the model at the rougher and final stages.
- Carried out cross-validation of models, the best model of choice is Linear regression.
- Evaluation of the model on the test sample confirmed the choice. SMAPE = 9.59. With a sMAPE value for the sample mean of 9.78.
