Choice of location for the oil well

There is oil samples in three regions: in each of 10,000 fields, where the quality of oil and the volume of its reserves have been measured. Build a machine learning model to help determine the region where mining will bring the most profit. Analyze possible profits and risks using the Bootstrap. technique

Steps to choose a location:
- In the selected region customer is looking for deposits, for each, the values of the signs are determined;
- Build a model and estimate the volume of reserves;
- Select the deposits with the highest value estimates. The number of fields depends on the company's budget and the cost of developing one well;
- The profit is equal to the total profit of the selected fields.

General conclusion

- The most promising regions in terms of the average predicted amount of raw materials are the 1st and 3rd regions.
- To open a well, it is necessary to have at least 111.11 units of raw materials in it (taking into account that 1 unit of raw materials is 1000 barrels).
- To develop a region, it is necessary that all wells in this region have at least 22,222.22 units of raw materials (assuming that one unit is 1,000 barrels).
- The maximum profit can be obtained from 200 wells in the first region.
- The average profit is the highest in the second region.
- The probability of losses is the lowest in the second region, only 0.4%.

Region selection

- It is recommended to explore the second region, as it is predicted to have the highest profits and the lowest losses.
