Work plan

- Make a portrait of the user of each region.
- Check the hypotheses.

General conclusion

- After 1995, the production of games began to grow sharply, and after 2009 it also fell sharply. Perhaps this is due to the fact that game developers have switched to the production of games for smartphones, it may be more profitable to make a game on a smartphone than on a gaming platform or on a PC.
- The average life of a gaming platform is about 10 years, so it is not profitable to make a game on those gaming platforms that are ending their lifespan.
- The top sellers in recent years are PS3, PS4 and XBox 360. But when producing a new game, it is better to focus on PS4 and Xbox One, because the games for them are still relevant at the end of 2016.
- There is a correlation between critics' ratings and sales of games, it is average and direct. There is no correlation between player ratings and game sales.
- Shooters, sports and rpg show the best sales figures, if we take into account sales worldwide.
- For sales in Europe, it is better to make an action or shooter on PS4 with an M rating.
- For sales in Japan, it's better to do RPG or action on 3DS, but the rating will have to be obtained from a Japanese rating agency.
- For sales in North America, it is better to make an action or shooter for Xbox One with an M rating.
- Players in third world countries as well as in America and Europe like games more cover, so the M rating will be just right. The platform is more likely PS4, but Xbox One is also suitable.
- If you want to do something universal, then itâ€™s better not to do it, nothing good happens universal, anyway, someone will not like it. But still, the game for all regions should be made multiplatform. As for the rating, you can do M (you still get your own in Japan) or E, there are a lot of playing children and adults in the world who want to return to childhood or play with the whole family.
- As for the PC, they will still play on it, and sometimes the ratings on it are higher than on the console (for example, on the same XBox). Also, the game for PC will be relevant longer, since upgrading a computer to a new generation is easier than changing a console.
- Sports and action show the same ratings, so you can make a game in any of these genres.
