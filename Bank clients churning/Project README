Customers began to leave Beta-Bank. Every month. A little, but noticeable. Banking marketers figured it was cheaper to keep current customers than to attract new ones.
It is necessary to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not. You are provided with historical data on customer behavior and termination of agreements with the bank.
Build a model with an extremely large F1-measure. To pass the project successfully, you need to bring the metric to 0.59. Check the F1-measure on the test set yourself.
Additionally, measure the AUC-ROC, compare its value with the F1-measure.
